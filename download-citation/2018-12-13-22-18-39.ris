N2  - In this paper, user-defined copper conductive patterns were successfully fabricated via electroless deposition onto paper substrate by using a four-step treatment process. The pristine paper samples are first dipped in 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) solution to form a uniform layer for the subsequent absorption of gold nanoparticles. Then the paper samples were wax patterned and immersed in gold nanoparticles solution in preparation for the next step electroless deposition. Herein, wax pattern was achieved via a stylus printer to print desired stencil dot matrix, which acted as hydrophobic channels, onto the paper substrate. FT-IR measurement, ultrasonic washing test and Scotch®-tape test were utilized to investigate the interaction mechanism between APTMS molecules and paper substrate. Contact angle measurement demonstrated that the hydrophobic surface of wax patterned paper. SEM images showed that the thickness of copper conductive patterns was estimated to be 2.44 μm, which was corresponding well with Surface Profiler measurement. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the copper films deposited on paper substrate has a structure with Cu (1 1 1) preferred orientation and the resistivity of Cu patterns measured by a digital four-point probe was 6.8 µΩ cm, which was 4.2 times of the bulk Cu. Notably, only one cycle of printing wax on paper substrate could successfully regulate the deposition area of Cu films. Those above advantages make this method a promising candidate for applications in constructing functional flexible electronic devices.

N2  - We report that both low electric resistivity and strong adhesion to polyimide film were attained for a conductive Cu film prepared by low-temperature sintering of 2-amino-1-butanol-protected Cu nanoparticles (AB-Cu NPs) with an average size of 4.4 nm. The sintering temperature of 60 °C for the AB-Cu NPs is the lowest ever reported for Cu NPs. A nanoink comprising these AB-Cu NPs (~35 wt% Cu) produced a conductive Cu film with resistivity of 52 μΩ cm after heating at 150 °C under a nitrogen flow. The adhesion to a polyimide film was compared for films prepared from nanoinks consisting of three different types of alkanol-amine-based Cu NPs: AB-Cu NPs, 1-amino-2-propanol-Cu NPs, and 3-amino-1-propanol-Cu NPs. Only the Cu film prepared from the AB-Cu nanoink established strong adhesion to the substrate without decreasing the electrical conductivity. The adhesiveness is attributed to residual oxidation products after thermal sintering of the Cu nanoinks.

N2  - Conventional electronic circuits are made up of electronic components assembled on either rigid substrates like FR4 and ceramic or on flexible substrates based on polymers such as polyimide, PET and PEN foils. The latter type of substrates offers considerable improvements in freedom of motion over its rigid complement although the deformations are still pretty limited due to the inability of common electronic materials, such as metals, to cope with the corresponding deformation. Moreover, the assembly of rigid electronic components can often reduce the circuit’s ability to bend. The current trend towards increased component density on substrates makes the final assembly even less flexible. However, electronic circuits which can fully conform and easily fit in the arbitrary curved surface topologies are of keen interest in various areas of applications. Aside from flexibility, a certain degree of stretching is required for the three-dimensional shaping of electronic systems. Hence, deformability will offer electronics a number of additional features like bendability, conformability shaping and lightweight. Three-dimensional shaped electronics can be obtained either by multi-time (dynamic or elastic) or one time (static, permanent) stretching. In this paper an introduction on deformable and conformable electronics is outlined highlighting the different existing approaches. Some examples of flexible and stretchable electronic applications will be provided in various fields.

N2  - The effect that the deformation state exerts on both the electrical and the mechanical degradation of Cu thin film on a flexible PI substrate was investigated via cyclic sliding test. Two opposite types of deformation (tension and compression) were applied to Cu thin film depending on its outward or inward placement in the cyclic sliding test system. During the cyclic sliding test, the change in electrical resistance of the Cu thin films was monitored using a two-point probe method. Systematic surface observation of deformed Cu thin film under the two opposite types of deformation was performed following specific cycles of sliding motion. Surface observation based on field emission scanning electron microscopy and 3D confocal laser scanning microscopy had been done to quantify the evolution of intrusion extrusions and surface roughness on the deformed Cu thin film. The distribution of microcracks significantly depended on the type of stress/strain applied to the Cu thin film on a flexible PI substrate during the cyclic sliding test. Finite element analysis was performed to explain the deformation behavior of the Cu thin film on a flexible PI substrate during the cyclic sliding test.

N2  - Chalcopyrite copper indium gallium diselenide Cu(Ga0.3In0.7)Se2 films have been deposited on polyimide (PI) plastic substrate by chemical spray pyrolysis using different substrate temperatures in the range from 350°C to 395°C. The influence of substrate temperature on the structural and optical properties of the CIGS films was studied. High-resolution x-ray diffraction results revealed that the films exhibited chalcopyrite-type structure. The crystallite size of the films increased with increasing substrate temperature, as did their root-mean-square surface roughness. Optical transmission measurements by ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer showed that the optical bandgap decreased from 1.28 eV to 1.16 eV as the substrate temperature was increased. This variation of the crystallite size and energy bandgap with substrate temperature makes such films a promising candidate for application in optoelectronic devices such as photoconductors and solar cells.

N2  - Thin films and thin film devices have a ubiquitous presence in numerous conventional and emerging technologies. This is because of the recent advances in nanotechnology, the development of functional and smart materials, conducting polymers, molecular semiconductors, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, and the employment of unique properties of thin films and ultrathin films, such as high surface area, controlled nanostructure for effective charge transfer, and special physical and chemical properties, to develop new thin film devices. This paper is therefore intended to provide a concise critical review and research directions on most thin film devices, including thin film transistors, data storage memory, solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, thermoelectric devices, smart materials, sensors, and actuators. The thin film devices may consist of organic, inorganic, and composite thin layers, and share similar functionality, properties, and fabrication routes. Therefore, due to the multidisciplinary nature of thin film devices, knowledge and advances already made in one area may be applicable to other similar areas. Owing to the importance of developing low-cost, scalable, and vacuum-free fabrication routes, this paper focuses on thin film devices that may be processed and deposited from solution.

Owing to the importance of developing low-cost, scalable, and vacuum-free fabrication routes, this paper focuses on thin film devices that may be processed and deposited from solution.

N2  - Thin films and thin film devices have a ubiquitous presence in numerous conventional and emerging technologies. This is because of the recent advances in nanotechnology, the development of functional and smart materials, conducting polymers, molecular semiconductors, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, and the employment of unique properties of thin films and ultrathin films, such as high surface area, controlled nanostructure for effective charge transfer, and special physical and chemical properties, to develop new thin film devices. This paper is therefore intended to provide a concise critical review and research directions on most thin film devices, including thin film transistors, data storage memory, solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, thermoelectric devices, smart materials, sensors, and actuators. The thin film devices may consist of organic, inorganic, and composite thin layers, and share similar functionality, properties, and fabrication routes. Therefore, due to the multidisciplinary nature of thin film devices, knowledge and advances already made in one area may be applicable to other similar areas.

N2  - In this work, the region-selective electroless copper plating on the surface of calcium carbonate (CaCO3)-filled polyehtylene (PE) (CFP) films have been established based on printing primer by screen printing in combination with electroless copper plating. Results showed only the printed areas formed amine groups on the surface of CFP sheets, which served as cores for adsorbing Pd2+ ions. Thus, the pattern on the screen was transferred to the surface of CFP sheets after electroless plating. When the plated time increased from 5 to 120 min, the thickness of plated coating was enhanced from 0.12 to 10 μm and the electrical resistivity was decreased from 12,544 to 0.4 Ω cm. The blown PE films mixed with foam powders and CaCO3 powders could form the coarse surface which can provide a large area for mechanical anchor between the primer and the plated coating, resulting in a better adhesion of the plated coating. In addition, the copper patterning possessed excellent selectivity, compactness, and flexibility. The EMI-SE of plated CFP films is above 30 dB.

N2  - Highly stretchable supersensitive sensors represent a new epoch in the field of intelligent medical devices. Applications include the detection of various stimuli of the human body and environmental monitoring around biological surfaces. To provide more accurate measurement results, stretchable sensors must be tightly attached on the skin surface or to clothing. Consequently, stretchable sensors must fulfill many requirements, such as high stretchability, high comfortability, high sensitivity, and long-term wear. To address these challenges, investigators have devoted considerable research effort to the development of technology, and much progress has been achieved. Here, recent developments with stretchable sensors are described, including human motion monitoring sensors, vital sign monitoring sensors, and sensors for environmental monitoring around biological surfaces. The latest successful examples of supersensitive sensors for achieving stretchability by novel materials or structures are reviewed. In the next section, recent advances regarding processing technology innovations are introduced. Future research directions and challenges in developing a highly stretchable supersensitive sensor for wearable biomedical applications are also discussed. With the development of new materials and novel technologies, and given the interdisciplinary nature of the research, the functionalities of stretchable sensors will become more powerful, and stretchable sensor technology will become more mature.

To address these challenges, investigators have devoted considerable research effort to the development of technology, and much progress has been achieved. Here, recent developments with stretchable sensors are described, including human motion monitoring sensors, vital sign monitoring sensors, and sensors for environmental monitoring around biological surfaces. The latest successful examples of supersensitive sensors for achieving stretchability by novel materials or structures are reviewed. In the next section, recent advances regarding processing technology innovations are introduced. Future research directions and challenges in developing a highly stretchable supersensitive sensor for wearable biomedical applications are also discussed. With the development of new materials and novel technologies, and given the interdisciplinary nature of the research, the functionalities of stretchable sensors will become more powerful, and stretchable sensor technology will become more mature.

N2  - This paper proposed a simple way to prepare electrically conductive multifunctional fabrics made by imparting copper nanoparticles and followed with copper electroplating. The surface and ageing properties of copper nanoparticles coated fabric were investigated. Furthermore, the problems regarding ageing properties were solved in a very simple way and various functional properties were studied. The effect of electroplating parameters (concentration of acid) against the stretch rate of fabric was studied. The influence of operating parameters on copper nanoparticles coated fabrics were characterized by Zetasizer, scanning electron micrograph, X-ray diffraction analysis, differential scanning calorimeter. Increase in electrical properties with the rate of weight gain was analyzed. The utility of simple nanoparticles coated and copper electroplated conductive fabrics were analyzed for electromagnetic shielding ability over a frequency range of 30 MHz–1.5 GHz. Furthermore, the heating performances of the fabrics were studied through measuring the change in temperature at the surface of the fabric while applying a voltage difference across the fabric. Moreover, the role coated fabrics against anti-corrosion test was performed to check the durability of electroplating.

N2  - Considerable progress has been made over the last decades in thermal spray technologies, practices and applications. However, like other technologies, they have to continuously evolve to meet new problems and market requirements. This article aims to identify the current challenges limiting the evolution of these technologies and to propose research directions and priorities to meet these challenges. It was prepared on the basis of a collection of short articles written by experts in thermal spray who were asked to present a snapshot of the current state of their specific field, give their views on current challenges faced by the field and provide some guidance as to the R&D required to meet these challenges. The article is divided in three sections that deal with the emerging thermal spray processes, coating properties and function, and biomedical, electronic, aerospace and energy generation applications.

N2  - The authors describe a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) based bismuth (Bi) film electrode that can be directly deployed for in-situ determination of zinc(II) ions. The use of an LCP warrants improved operational reliability, high durability, and flexibility of the sensor, allowing it to be mounted on any flat or shaped surface. Square wave anodic stripping voltammetry shows the sensor to be able to detect Zn(II) (−1.64 V vs. thin-film Ag/AgCl reference electrode) in concentrations as low as 1.22 nM at a deposition time of 180 s. Other figures of merit include (a) an analytical sensitivity of 1.55 nA∙nM−1∙mm−2, (b) a linear detection range extending from 4.59 to 1071 nM, (c) a repeatability with a relative standard deviation of 3.35% (for n = 10), (d) a reproducibility with a relative standard deviation of 1.64% (for n = 6). Real-time applicability of the sensor for in-situ detection was demonstrated by determination of Zn(II) in seawater. In an extension of the method, a flexible sensor array consisting of four LCP-based sensors was attached to the hull of an autonomous kayak, which was remotely operated. The response of the sensor array indicated a clear trace of Zn(II) concentrations in seawater. This was confirmed by ICP-MS analysis. The results suggest the potential usage of the flexible LCP electrochemical sensor for in-situ monitoring.

N2  - In this study, we present a new simple method using formic acid pretreatment to achieve low temperature sintering of Cu nanoparticles, and the Cu nanoparticles have been successfully prepared with a modified polyol method. For formic acid pretreatment, the spherical Cu nanoparticles with an average size of 30 nm were saturated with a mixed solution of formic acid and absolute ethanol directly. The surface composition analysis indicated that the initial oxide on the surface of Cu nanoparticles was completely removed, and formate was generated as a by-product which could decompose at low temperature. According to the thermal analysis results, it was found that the sintering temperature of Cu nanoparticles with formic acid pretreatment was reduced to 160 °C. And the corresponding microstructures further demonstrated that the emerging small exothermic peak of thermal curve over the temperature range between 120 and 160 °C was caused by the formation of sintering necks. The formic acid treated Cu nanoparticle films sintered at 260 and 320 °C exhibited an electrical resistivity of 6.1 and 3.6 μΩ cm respectively.

N2  - This paper presents fabrication methods for some Multi Walled Carbon Nano Tube (MWCNT)/epoxy composites. These nanocomposite are characterized with respect to temperature and strain. The effect of parameters such as sonication time, percolation threshold, film thickness, use of substrate and formation of electric contact have been observed. These nanocomposites are fabricated: (i) with mould without substrate, (ii) without mould on poly ethylene terephthalate substrate, (iii) without mould without substrate and (iv) without mould without substrate with embedded electrode wire. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope of these samples is done to measure the dispersion and agglomerates formation of CNT bundles into polymer matrices. Piezoresistive characterization of these samples with respect to temperature and strain is performed. This paper gives a novel strategy for fabricating a highly sensitive MWCNT/epoxy strain sensor with excellent repeatability.

N2  - As a result of the rise in processing power demands of today’s personal computers, water-cooled pin fin heat sinks are increasingly being employed for the cooling of graphical processing units. Currently, these high-performance devices are manufactured through high-cost, high-waste processes. In recent years, a new solution has emerged using the cold gas dynamic spray process, in which pin fins are manufactured onto a base plate by spraying metallic powder particles through a mask allowing for a high degree of adaptability to different graphics processing unit shapes and sizes. One drawback of this process is reduced deposition efficiency, resulting in a fair portion of the feedstock powder being wasted as substrate sensitivity to heat and mechanical residual stresses requires the use of reduced spray parameters. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using powder recycling to mitigate this issue and compares coatings sprayed with reclaimed powder to their counterparts sprayed with as-received powder. The work demonstrates that cold gas dynamic spray is a highly flexible and economically competitive process for the production of pin fin heat sinks when using powder recycling. The heat transfer properties of the resulting fins are briefly addressed and demonstrated.

N2  - Functionalized nanocomposites based on various type of graphene nanomaterials including graphene, graphene oxides (GOs), and doped graphene (oxides) are widely used as materials for various sensors that can display high sensitivity, selectivity and stability. This review with 347 references summarizes advances in the preparation and functionalization of graphene nanocomposites for the application of electrochemical sensors and biosensors. Following a general introduction into the field, the article is divided into subsections on (a) the synthesis and functionalization of nanocomposites (made from graphene, various kinds of GOs, heteroatom-doped GOs), (b) on methods for functionalization of composites (with other carbon nanomaterials, metal nanoparticles, metal oxide and metal sulfide nanoparticles), (c) on functionalization with inorganic materials including polyoxometalates, hexacyanoferrates, minerals), (d) on functionalization with organic materials such as amino acids, surfactants, organic dyes, ionic liquids, macrocycles (including cyclodextrins, crown ethers and calixarenes), and (e) on functionalization with organometallics and with various other organic compounds, (f) on functionalizations with polymers such as conventional polymers, polyelectrolytes, conducting polymers, molecularly imprinted polymers, (g) on functionalization with biomolecules including proteins and nucleic acids. Other subsections cover flexible graphene and GO based nanocomposites and 3D composites. Application of graphene and GO nanocomposites are then covered in a in large section that comprises electrochemical sensors and biosensors (based on voltammetry, amperometry, potentiometry, impedimetry, electrochemiluminescence, photoelectrochemistry, field effect transistors, electrochemical immunosensors) with specific subsections on gas sensors, enzymatic biosensors and gene sensors. A concluding section covers current challenges and perspectives of graphene and GO based (bio)sensing.

N2  - Functionalized nanocomposites based on various type of graphene nanomaterials including graphene, graphene oxides (GOs), and doped graphene (oxides) are widely used as materials for various sensors that can display high sensitivity, selectivity and stability. This review with 347 references summarizes advances in the preparation and functionalization of graphene nanocomposites for the application of electrochemical sensors and biosensors. Following a general introduction into the field, the article is divided into subsections on (a) the synthesis and functionalization of nanocomposites (made from graphene, various kinds of GOs, heteroatom-doped GOs), (b) on methods for functionalization of composites (with other carbon nanomaterials, metal nanoparticles, metal oxide and metal sulfide nanoparticles), (c) on functionalization with inorganic materials including polyoxometalates, hexacyanoferrates, minerals), (d) on functionalization with organic materials such as amino acids, surfactants, organic dyes, ionic liquids, macrocycles (including cyclodextrins, crown ethers and calixarenes), and (e) on functionalization with organometallics and with various other organic compounds, (f) on functionalizations with polymers such as conventional polymers, polyelectrolytes, conducting polymers, molecularly imprinted polymers, (g) on functionalization with biomolecules including proteins and nucleic acids. Other subsections cover flexible graphene and GO based nanocomposites and 3D composites. Application of graphene and GO nanocomposites are then covered in a in large section that comprises electrochemical sensors and biosensors (based on voltammetry, amperometry, potentiometry, impedimetry, electrochemiluminescence, photoelectrochemistry, field effect transistors, electrochemical immunosensors) with specific subsections on gas sensors, enzymatic biosensors and gene sensors. A concluding section covers current challenges and perspectives of graphene and GO based (bio)sensing.

N2  - CuInS2 (CIS) nanostructure thin films were successfully synthesized on FTO conductive glass substrates by solvothermal method. It is found that the surface morphology and microstructure of CIS thin films can be tailored by simply adjusting the concentration of oxalic acid. CIS nanostructure films with texture of “nanosheet array” and “flower-like microsphere” were obtained and used as Pt-free counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The nanosheet array CIS was found to have a better electrocatalytic activity than the flower-like microsphere one. DSSCs based on nanosheet array CIS thin film counter electrode show conversion efficiency of 3.33 %, which is comparable to the Pt-catalyzed DSSCs. The easy synthesis, low cost, morphology tunable and excellent electrocatalytic property may make the CuInS2 nanostructure competitive as counter electrode in DSSCs.

DSSCs based on nanosheet array CIS thin film counter electrode show conversion efficiency of 3.33 %, which is comparable to the Pt-catalyzed DSSCs. The easy synthesis, low cost, morphology tunable and excellent electrocatalytic property may make the CuInS2 nanostructure competitive as counter electrode in DSSCs.

N2  - This review focuses on the investigation and development of various support materials in TiO2 photocatalyst system with special emphasis on the photodecolorization of synthetic dyes. Efforts have been devoted to find suitable support material of TiO2 for improving its recovery efficiency and adsorption capability. The relationship between the structural characteristics and physicochemical reactivity properties of the supported TiO2 photocatalysis has been highlighted. The vicinity of photocatalysis and support system significantly accelerated the transfer step between adsorption and overall oxidative of decolorization process. Comparison of the photodecolorization with several synthetic dyes has been made and concluded that the photocatalytic activities have been influenced by the structural and surface properties of the photocatalyst.

N2  - The Gerda collaboration is performing a sensitive search for neutrinoless double beta decay of \(^{76}\hbox {Ge}\) at the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy. The upgrade of the Gerda experiment from Phase I to Phase II has been concluded in December 2015. The first Phase II data release shows that the goal to suppress the background by one order of magnitude compared to Phase I has been achieved. Gerda is thus the first experiment that will remain “background-free” up to its design exposure (\(\hbox {100 kg}~\hbox {year}\)). It will reach thereby a half-life sensitivity of more than \(10^{26}\) year within 3 years of data collection. This paper describes in detail the modifications and improvements of the experimental setup for Phase II and discusses the performance of individual detector components.

N2  - The desire of flexibility, light weight and low cost in current electronic device has increased the application of flexible printed circuit board (FPCB). This paper aims to investigate the effect of different Reynolds number (Re) toward FPCB attached with ball grid array (BGA) package in different arrangements. Actual BGA package with 100 solder joints incorporating FPCB was attached to a fixture in wind tunnel test section to perform FPCB’s deflection analysis with different flow velocities and package’s configurations. Furthermore, numerical simulation was also performed to obtain numerical deflection and stress value. The findings show that the Reynolds numbers have a substantial effect to the FPCB’s deflection and stress. However, the BGA package’s positions on the FPCB were found to be insignificant to the responses. The actual BGA package on FPCB as presented in this paper will represent more realistic values of determined FPCB’s deflection and stress.

N2  - The desire of flexibility, light weight and low cost in current electronic device has increased the application of flexible printed circuit board (FPCB). This paper aims to investigate the effect of different Reynolds number (Re) toward FPCB attached with ball grid array (BGA) package in different arrangements. Actual BGA package with 100 solder joints incorporating FPCB was attached to a fixture in wind tunnel test section to perform FPCB’s deflection analysis with different flow velocities and package’s configurations. Furthermore, numerical simulation was also performed to obtain numerical deflection and stress value. The findings show that the Reynolds numbers have a substantial effect to the FPCB’s deflection and stress. However, the BGA package’s positions on the FPCB were found to be insignificant to the responses. The actual BGA package on FPCB as presented in this paper will represent more realistic values of determined FPCB’s deflection and stress.

N2  - The patent literature concerning thermal spraying for biomedical applications is reviewed in this contribution. The patents were compiled from multiple databases search spanning the 2005-2018 period. For clarity and ease of reading, the results have been grouped into sections according to four individual material groups (apatites, titanium, oxide ceramics, other), with the secondary sorting criterion being related to the specific bioapplication areas (maxillofacial, orthopedic, methods). Lastly, the patents are grouped according to the selected thermal spray method within the individual subsections. In the paper, recent R&D trends in this field are further identified and briefly commented.

N2  - A number of different parts for mechanical testing were produced using composite metal foil manufacturing (CMFM). This process is a combination of laminated object manufacturing and brazing technology. Aluminium is one of the toughest metals to join and CMFM can achieve this task with ease. By using aluminium 1050 foils of 0.1 mm thickness, various parts were made according to British and International Standards, including lap joints, peel specimens, dog-bone specimens and tested for their mechanical properties. A special, 80 % zinc and 20 % aluminium by weight, brazing paste was utilized for joining the foils together. The test of the single lap joints show that none of the specimens failed at the bonded area and the failure was always due to fracture of the parent metal. Cohesive failure was also observed for the single lap joints by using 10 mm thick aluminium metal plates. It helped in calculating the lap shear strength which is a useful design parameter. The peel test showed good bond consistency in all the specimens with an average peel strength of 20 MPa. Comparative tensile test was conducted with a dog-bone specimen machined from a solid block of aluminium 1050 and specimens made with CMFM. The results showed that the specimens made by CMFM fracture at force values that are higher than that of the parent metal. This demonstrates that CMFM has the capability to produce high quality and stronger parts as compared to conventional machining methods employed for the production of metal parts. The effect of using different number of layers for the same cross-sectional area has also been investigated.

N2  - A number of different parts for mechanical testing were produced using composite metal foil manufacturing (CMFM). This process is a combination of laminated object manufacturing and brazing technology. Aluminium is one of the toughest metals to join and CMFM can achieve this task with ease. By using aluminium 1050 foils of 0.1 mm thickness, various parts were made according to British and International Standards, including lap joints, peel specimens, dog-bone specimens and tested for their mechanical properties. A special, 80 % zinc and 20 % aluminium by weight, brazing paste was utilized for joining the foils together. The test of the single lap joints show that none of the specimens failed at the bonded area and the failure was always due to fracture of the parent metal. Cohesive failure was also observed for the single lap joints by using 10 mm thick aluminium metal plates. It helped in calculating the lap shear strength which is a useful design parameter. The peel test showed good bond consistency in all the specimens with an average peel strength of 20 MPa. Comparative tensile test was conducted with a dog-bone specimen machined from a solid block of aluminium 1050 and specimens made with CMFM. The results showed that the specimens made by CMFM fracture at force values that are higher than that of the parent metal. This demonstrates that CMFM has the capability to produce high quality and stronger parts as compared to conventional machining methods employed for the production of metal parts. The effect of using different number of layers for the same cross-sectional area has also been investigated.

N2  - OSIRIS-REx will return pristine samples of carbonaceous asteroid Bennu. This article describes how pristine was defined based on expectations of Bennu and on a realistic understanding of what is achievable with a constrained schedule and budget, and how that definition flowed to requirements and implementation. To return a pristine sample, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft sampling hardware was maintained at level 100 A/2 and <180 ng/cm2 of amino acids and hydrazine on the sampler head through precision cleaning, control of materials, and vigilance. Contamination is further characterized via witness material exposed to the spacecraft assembly and testing environment as well as in space.

N2  - OSIRIS-REx will return pristine samples of carbonaceous asteroid Bennu. This article describes how pristine was defined based on expectations of Bennu and on a realistic understanding of what is achievable with a constrained schedule and budget, and how that definition flowed to requirements and implementation. To return a pristine sample, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft sampling hardware was maintained at level 100 A/2 and <180 ng/cm2 of amino acids and hydrazine on the sampler head through precision cleaning, control of materials, and vigilance. Contamination is further characterized via witness material exposed to the spacecraft assembly and testing environment as well as in space. This characterization provided knowledge of the expected background and will be used in conjunction with archived spacecraft components for comparison with the samples when they are delivered to Earth for analysis. Most of all, the cleanliness of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft was achieved through communication among scientists, engineers, managers, and technicians.

N2  - Biodegradable polymers are identified as substantial materials for biomedical applications. These polymers have the ability to deteriorate through an unpretentious hydrolysis and eliminated through kidneys’ functions or metabolic processes. Among widely used biodegradable polymers in biomedical applications, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is becoming one of the most paramount polymers. Synthesizing PLA through melt/solution polycondensation polymerizations makes it relatively easy to tailor properties of final product. However, their synthesis reactions are affected by several parameters such as polymerization time, temperature, pressure, catalysts, and the polarity of the solvent. Moreover, equilibrium reactions are controlled through utilizing a hydrophilic monomer such as ethylene glycol (EG). These factors can strongly impact final properties of PLA. Thus, it is indispensable to comprehend the effect of operating parameters during the polymerization process. Optimizing synthesis conditions can be accomplished through reducing side reactions. Furthermore, this can be achieved through racemization by utilizing chain extenders to build high molecular weight and enhance thermal stability. In this review, the design and fabrication of porous PLA scaffolds and their physicomechanical behavior are reviewed. Different PLA scaffold parameters were investigated thoroughly, which include biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mechanical properties for different porosity and pore sizes to mimic the complex architecture of the natural tissue regeneration.
